# Key Features

## True Self and Authenticity

The goal of research on true self and authenticity is generally twofold. The first is to answer a fundamental question: “what is true self, and what is authenticity?” We refer this research effort to as an epistemological approach to understanding true self and authenticity. Research with the epistemological approach has discovered that true self is a core aspect of one’s identity, has a moral essence, and is positively biased; thus, authenticity is more likely to be experienced when one acts in accord with their core values/interests, morality, and positive self-aspects. The second goal is to understand what true self and authenticity do for us, which we refer to as an instrumental approach.

## Existential Meaning and Sense-Making

Whether we like it or not, we eventually face a fundamental question about our existence: What is the meaning of my life? Existentialism and evolutionary science both suggest that our life has no a priori meaning; instead, existential psychology highlights the importance of meaning in life, a subjective sense of feeling one’s life meaningful. Research on existential meaning has examined the sources of meaning and the conditions and psychological states under which people search for meaning.

## Belief in Free Will and Sense of Hope

Do we have free will? Ontologically, the answer could be yes or no. Psychologically, however, it is more important to believe that we have free will. Research has discovered that endorsing a belief in free will is phenomenologically more natural and also has a moral-regulatory function.
